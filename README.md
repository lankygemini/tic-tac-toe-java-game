# Tic-Tac-Toe Java Game

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to take turns playing as 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three of their symbols in a row to win.

## Features

- **Two-Player Game:** Play locally with a friend.
- **Turn-based Play:** Players alternate turns between 'X' and 'O'.
- **Win and Draw Detection:** The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Simple Interface:** The game board is displayed in the console with an intuitive input system.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with Player 'X'.
2. Players will be prompted to enter the row and column where they want to place their symbol.
3. The first player to align three of their symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all nine spaces are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a draw.

## Controls

- Enter the row and column number to place your symbol. The grid is indexed from `0` to `2`.

Example:
```
Player X, enter your row (0, 1, 2) and column (0, 1, 2): 0 1
```
